## 🔧 Common Commands

Each project includes these standard Terraform commands:

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan infrastructure changes
terraform plan

# Apply changes
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Destroy infrastructure
terraform destroy -auto-approve

# View current state
terraform show

# Get output values
terraform output
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication errors:** Ensure you're logged into the appropriate cloud provider
- **Permission issues:** Check IAM roles and API token permissions
- **Network connectivity:** Verify internet connection for provider downloads
- **State conflicts:** Use proper remote state management
